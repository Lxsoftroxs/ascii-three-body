# ASCII Three-Body

A simple Python script that simulates the three-body problem in ASCII within your Linux terminal.  
Random initial positions and velocities are assigned to each body, and the simulation updates in real time.  

## Features
- Random initial positions and velocities
- Basic Euler integrator for gravitational motion
- ASCII visualization using `curses`

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `curses` module (typically included on Linux systems; on Arch Linux it comes with standard Python)

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run `python main.py` in your terminal.

## Usage
- Quit anytime using `Ctrl+C` or close the terminal.
- Adjust simulation parameters (e.g., time step, ASCII bounds) in the code as you wish.

## Notes
- This is a fun demo and not a high-precision simulator.
- For best results, use a relatively large terminal window.

Enjoy the cosmic chaos in ASCII form!
